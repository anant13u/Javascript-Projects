            <span class="text-header">Skill Assessment and Certifications</span>
            ACI operates as an impartial, third-party organization with no involvement in training 
            programs, which guarantees the quality and credibility of its assessments. Since 2015,

            qualified assessors under the DGET-Modular Employable Skills (MES) Courses, including 
            candidates who have acquired skills informally.

            The National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) is a quality assurance framework that 
            organizes qualifications according to levels of knowledge, skills, and aptitude. 
            Comprising ten levels, each represents a different level of complexity and expertise.
                <span class="list-point-parent">National Occupation Standards (NOS):</span>
                These standards define the measurable performance outcomes expected from individuals 
                in specific tasks, serving as benchmarks for various education and training programs.
                <span class="list-point-parent">Assessments: ACI’s assessments focus on:</span>
                ◦ Competency-Based Assessment: Collecting evidence and making judgments about 
                whether competency has been achieved, confirming an individual’s ability to 
                perform to workplace standards.
                ◦ Performance-Based Assessment: Measuring individual performance in the workplace.
                ◦ Student Learning Evidence: Demonstrating the extent to which students have met stated 
                goals or objectives.
            ACI's assessment approach emphasizes transparency, accountability, authenticity, validity, 
            reliability, flexibility, and fairness, utilizing a range of tools and tasks tailored to 
            occupational competencies and embracing an inclusive approach.
